## Known Limitations

### Current MVP
- Mock USDT deposit (no real blockchain integration)
- Manual balance updates via DB (no auto-mining yet)
- Season pass tier progression is manual
- No real-time leaderboard updates
- Limited to development environment

### Production Requirements
- Real TRC-20 USDT integration
- Background earnings worker
- Redis for caching and real-time data
- CDN for miner images
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Production database scaling

## Performance

### Optimization Techniques
- TanStack Query caching for API responses
- Lazy loading of pages
- Image optimization
- Database indexing on foreign keys
- Session-based auth (no JWT overhead)
- Static asset serving

### Load Handling
- Current: Suitable for up to 1,000 concurrent users
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- Frontend: Vite HMR in dev, optimized build for production

## Security

### Implemented
✅ OIDC authentication with Replit
✅ Secure session management
✅ SQL injection prevention (Drizzle ORM)
✅ Input validation on all endpoints
✅ CORS configuration
✅ HTTPS enforcement (Replit platform)

### Best Practices
- Never expose secret keys
- Session secret rotation
- Database credentials in env vars
- Transaction validation before execution
- Balance checks before purchases

## Deployment

### Current Setup
- Hosted on Replit
- Auto-deploys from main branch
- Database auto-provisioned by Replit
- HTTPS and domain managed by Replit

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Database seeded with initial data
- [ ] Session secret generated
- [ ] Analytics tracking added
- [ ] Error monitoring configured
- [ ] Backup strategy implemented

## Support & Maintenance

### Logs
- Application logs: Check Replit console
- Database queries: Drizzle query logging
- Client errors: Browser console
- API responses: Network tab

### Common Issues
1. **Login fails:** Check REPLIT_DOMAINS env var
2. **Images not loading:** Verify attached_assets served correctly
3. **Balance not updating:** Check transaction creation
4. **Season pass locked:** Verify user has sufficient balance
